:warning: **This is source code for my [bachelors thesis](https://github.com/danbalarin/bachelors-thesis) written in Czech** :czech_republic:

This repository contains application and everything should be in english, and everything not code related (thesis itself, analysis, etc.) will be in the other repository, completely in czech. If there would be anyone interested, I can translate any part, *just hit me up in the DM's* (not really, email would be enough)

# PRs
I will **NOT** merge any pull requests until the [thesis](https://github.com/danbalarin/bachelors-thesis) is fully submitted and my finals are over.
